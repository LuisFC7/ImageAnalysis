Weighted median
First of all decide if we're gonna keep in mind borders of image
Input: Image
Algorithm:
  
  if we keep in mind borders
    First expand matrix n+1 * m+1
    fill with zeros
    
 By doing this, now
 Apply mask 1/9[1 1 1, 1 1 1, 1 1 1] for every pixel excluding borders with value zero
 After that Algorithm median its gonna be called for every p√≠xel.
